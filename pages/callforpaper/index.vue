              after receiving the paper and then at the stage of acceptance.
              Though OTCON 2.0 will carefully check for plagiarism, there are
              some possibilities for wrong plagiarism results, hence OTCON 2.0
              encourages the authors to take sole responsibility for plagiarism
              when they are ready to submit their papers.
